<h3>Social Icon Bar & More colors</h3>
<p>
    Having a social bar on personal or commercial pages is very common these days. I love photography and decided to include links to my Flickr and Instagram accouns.

    The simplest way was to just include links in the home page footer or use easily available icons on the web. I started with having plain social icons with links to corrosponding accounts. Even though it looked nice I decided to make it little more interesting by adding simple zooming effect using jQuery animation.
    I would prefer avoiding use of heavy animation in UI in general. It is fun to use animated UI in the beginning but soon it gets boring and a snappy UI would beat such UI any time. However, if animation is kept to minimum and used cleaverly with simple effects it just feels nice.

   I started by defining CSS for holding icons at the center of the page in the footer. I reused CSS that displayed main menu, defined new classes for 'social-bar' in main.css. 
    Then I added jQuery code to animate by capturing mouseenter and mouseleave functions. Simple animation trick is to set height and width of the icon for each mouse event and then leave it up to jQuery to generate intermediate frames to get a pleasing effect.

    I also made my main navigation more colorful. I chose Microsoft/Google style multiple color scheme. I hope you like it!

<h3>Instagram Location Listing (with authentication)</h3>
<p>
The real purpose of my last experiment was to implmenet authentication so that I can use Instagram's location search API.
    Since I had already obtained user's current latitude longitude information automatically, I had to carefully put everything together and 
    invoke the API call to get list of tagges locations around the latitude and longitude provided.
    Check the <a href="../project/whatsclickin/index.html">project home page</a> to see location listing implemented. 
    After you complete authentication, click on the blue button to get list of locations around me. Depending on your connecting speed,
    there might be a wait for 2-3 seconds before you will get a response. The list returned is basically the locations marked by Instagram
    users while uploading images. Since most locations on Instagram are coming from Foursquare, you will also get local businesses around you.

    Next steps: Along with the location names, I also get a location id which I can use to make another call to fetch images associated with that Id. 
    I will implmenet this step in my next and perhaps the final experiment before I put everything together and develop the home page for project.

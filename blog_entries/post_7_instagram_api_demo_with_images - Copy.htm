<h3>Instagram API demo updated with Images</h3>
<p>
    I decided to take the API demo experiment done last week to the next level. To display images after extracting them from JSON, 
    with a Twitter Bootstrap based theme, I am using <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery">Blueimp</a> 
    plugin to display image thumbnails. I then extracted images inside success: tag in the ajax call. After examining the return data object from Instagram
    I was able to locate the image url, its direct link on Instagram and loads of other information including image location, user info, tags etc.

    I need to explore other API on instagram as the next step that would give me ability to find images based on location provided.

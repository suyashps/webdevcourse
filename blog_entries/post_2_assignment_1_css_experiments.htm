<h3>CSS Experiments</h3>
<p>
The first <a href="http://annunziato.org/academia/mod/assignment/view.php?id=384">assignment</a> was to create several HTML/CSS experiments. I had already done some CSS experiments for setting up my home page so I decided to take it one step further.</p>
<p>
Here are few <a href="../experiments/exp_1_css.aspx">experiments</a> I have done so far. I have created sections and styled them in <a href="../css/experiments.css">experiment.css</a> as per the assignment's requirements of using CSS classes and inheriting properties. Two sections inherit 'section' class however, define custom properties based on their unique ID.</p>
<p>Later I moved on to creating additional experiments with images. First was to write CSS for circular image. The trick is to set border radius exactly 50% of the height and width (which should be equal). This was straight forward. However, if image aspect ration is not 1:1 it gets skewed. 
    So I thought it is much better to have a div which itself is circular. I then set the a background image of this div and we get the desired effect. This time even though image is not skewed, it needs to be resized. This way it need not have the same aspect ratio.

    We can even create circular buttons without using images as shown in the next experiment. I wrote a small JQuery script which picks a random color for each click inside the div. May be I should use this somewhere on my homepage. It would be cool to have a social icon bar as my next experiment!

<h3>Current location using web service</h3>
<p>
    After successfully trying the Instagram API next step for me was to start exploring its location specific API. As I began experimenting with that API 
    I realized that before I could fetch images based on location I needed two things:
    </p>
<ol>
    <li>An elegant way to get user's current location</li>
    <li>A way to translate current location (latitude, longitude) in Instagram compatible format </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I explored various options for 1. Simplest was to rely on JavaScript's geolocation API and prompt user for their user.
    This is the most direct method as it gives your geo coordinates directly but somehow I did not like it. It is very intrusive and not user friendly.
    I have seen some websites knowing about your approximate location as soon as you land on their page. Since I do not need user's precise location I realized that I need 
    a non-intrusive solution. Then I came across <a href="http://freegeoip.net/json/">this webservice</a> which magically provides good enough infomration without even waiting for user.
    This is really nice approxmation of user's location to begin with.

    Please check the experiment page for a demo. Now I can pass on these coordinates to Instagram's location search API which I am experimenting with. Unfortunately it needs user authentication with instagram before I could proceed.
    So I need to setup instagram authentication before I could process the location I receive via this web service.

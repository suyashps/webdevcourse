<h3>Instagram Authentication (client side)</h3>
<p>
    Out of the two things listed in my last blog I covered the first one in my last experiment. Next step was to get the Instgram authentication in place.
    </p>
<p>
    Instagram provides two types of authentication: Client side and sever side. While server side is more secure and hence recommended, the client side
    authentication is usually meant for pure javascript applications. I am realizing that I can build this app completly using JS only. 
    </p>
<p>Earlier, I was thinking that I may need to store some user information. Now since I learned that I dont need to store the access toekn as I can get it 
    whenever I need it purly from JS, I may not even need to store other information also. I can request for this information from Instagram in real-time as long as I have this token. It will be exciting to build a pure JS app 
    if I can pull it off.  
    <p>
        Go ahead and try the demo the <a href="../project/whatsclickin/index.html">project home page</a> that I just put up. This is also the first time I setup dedicated URL for the app (which I have to register with Instagram).
    So I would be using this home page for my future experiments as I build the project.

    Next steps: Now I have authentication in place, I can use of the location/search api which requires user authentication.

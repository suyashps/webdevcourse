<h3>Responsive Design on Homepage and CSS Experiment</h3>
<p>
    I have used @media queries for screensize smaller than 480px to cover iphone and other mobile devices. I essentially redesigned navigation CSS 
    such that it looks better on iPhone. I transformed menu from horizontal to vertical, increased font-size, resized text display area between footer and main nav 
    and also made some adjustments to my social bar css. Essentially I fixed their sizes in such a way that they appear better together. 
    Since I was using percentage based widths I had to make it fixes size. I know there is a better way to rewrite my initial CSS so that I could have made minimum changes to it in order to fit for a mobile screen.

<p>Here are some screenshots from my iPhone5</p>
<div style="width:50%;">
    <img src="../images/screen1.png" style="width:40%;float:left;border-color:black;border-style:solid;margin-right:5%">
    <img src="../images/screen2.png" style="width:40%;border-color:black;border-style:solid;">
</div>
<p>
    Another change I have tried is to detect device OS userAgent type in javascript code to turn off animation. In fact it is more powerful than what I had used it for. 
    May be in future I will explore it further.

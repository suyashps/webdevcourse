<h3>Website is live!</h3>
<p>
This is my first blog entry! I am excited to be pat of this course as it gives me chance to build a website of my own which I always wanted to do. I have learend HTML/CSS in an ad-hoc manner before but this time it feels much better to have a formal course centered on web development.

So first task was to design my homepage. I had lot of ideas in my mind (before I bagan this course). However, I decided to go with a minimalistic design as it will help me spend less time on choosing colors or fancy looking elements and instead focus on writing code that does something useful. I am going to use very few colors other than shades of black and white. 
    Along with JQuery, I am planning to use the popular Twitter Bootstrap as main styling framework in future as it also has nice set of minimalistic, professional looking design elements.

    I have done some CSS experiemnt on the homepage such as the round image. As the CSS part was getting larger I ended up moving everything in a saperate CSS file (main.css). I will write about these experiments in my next blogpost about first homework.

<h3>JQuery Experiment</h3>
<p>Here is a JQuery <a href="../experiments/exp_2_jquery.aspx">experiment</a> that uses few JQuery and JQuery UI functions. It allows user to create rectangles dynamically and then add it to a list. Each rectangle gets a color randomly from a pool of colors.
User can also drag these rectangles and rearrange them in different order. Each rectangle can be uniquely identified a dynamically generated ID.
    </p>
<p>Throughout the experiment I have used several JQuery functions that involved selecting tags, retriving and cloning HTML, 
    setting DOM attributes dynamically, updating CSS using code. I defined a template of rectangle with insitally hiding it by setting 
    display as none. It also has a heading that gets updated after the template is cloned using JQuery. Then I modify its attribute to make it visible before inserting it into DOM
    .</p>
<p>The whole list is them made sortable that lets you rearranging rectangles in any order. Have fun!</p>

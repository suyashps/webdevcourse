<h3>Instagram API demo</h3>
<p>
    This week we didnt have any experiment. Instead we had to write the project proposal document. 
    So I spent some time exploring Instagram API which I will be working with for my project.
    I created a developer account and registered my app. That gave me a CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET. 
    Basically I will have to provide CLIENT_ID for each API call. I am yet to figure out where secret will be used.

    Once I had it setup I created a simple <a href="../story/storyfiles/exp_4_instagram_API_test1.html">experiment</a> to fetch a JSON response using Instagram's media API. 
    It basically gives me list of latest popular contents on Instagram. It can be examined by pasting response in any JSON viewer online.

    Next step will be to write some HTML/CSS to display these images on my page and then explore other API such as Geolocation or Media search that would give me location specific images.
